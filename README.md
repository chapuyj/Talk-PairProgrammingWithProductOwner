# GraalBank / Talk and pair programming

This repository is an example result associated with a talk where I pair with a Product Owner. We are acting like a real work day. It start with a big user story and our goal will be to produce a feature together, in live coding (~40min).

This talk is accessible for everyone, and it concerns everyone. Developer or not. It is about collaboration. Some concepts are introduced throughout the live coding like writing user stories, acceptance tests (gherkin), pair programming, acceptance and unit tests, TDD, DDD, etc.
